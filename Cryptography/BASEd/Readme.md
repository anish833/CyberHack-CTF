```

This is a base64 cipher so going to ```cyberchef``` and decoding it with base64 give me another cipher which was ```base32``` but I didn't have to 
figure that out ```cyberchef``` have a magic guess in the OUTPUT just click that it will automatically decode the possible cipher

The sequence of recipe was ```From base64 --> From base32 --> From base64``` and I got my flag

flag: ```cyberhack{Me-Myself-&-I_By_G-Eazy&BebeRexha}```
