Going to the link gave me a image 

<img src = 'Capture.PNG' />

After googling for some time and some reverse image search I found out it was ```Dancing Men Cipher``` and found a online decoder 
```https://www.dcode.fr/dancing-men-cipher```

So decoding it gave me ```FFFbyBebeRexha``` so enclosing this in cyberhack{} will be the flag

flag: ```cyberhack{FFFbyBebeRexha}```
