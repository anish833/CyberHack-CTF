Challenge:
```
Given: p=1299827 q=1299811 What is the value of n(modulus)? Answer format- cyberhack{value of n}
```
This is classic RSA calculation. RSA is very widely used public key cryptgraphy, to find n the formula is ```n = p*q```. Fire up python and do ```1299827*1299811```

flag:```cyberhack{1689529432697}```
