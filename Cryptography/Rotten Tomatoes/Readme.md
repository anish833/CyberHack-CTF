Challenge:
```
You know this, I know. Ciphertext- bxadqgzbj{25_Chm_Ld_Ozhrz_Fnk_Ronmrnqdc_Ax_Kzwlh_Etmcr}
```

Looks like a Shift cipher. Try Caeser Cipher , I used ```cyberchef``` and used ```Rot13``` recipe and tried changing the rotation and it was shifted by 1 character. So on
rotation 1 I got the flag

flag:```cyberhack{25_Din_Me_Paisa_Gol_Sponsored_By_Laxmi_Funds}```
