Challenge:
```
Mirror is such a strange object. 58 becomes 85. Cipher:MxQQRTnF8HhFbo9aNhZMC6GQuN44ns7SKX3wVL4dRHJ5FWt2S4p1ASetjb4a
```

This is some base cipher so I went to ```cyberchef``` and it recongnized this as base58 cipher after decoding it it gave me another cipher. The challenge
says ```58 becomes 85``` so I tried to decode with base85 and got the flag

flag: ```cyberhack{hope_you_are_enjoying!!!}```
